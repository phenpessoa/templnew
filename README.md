# templnew

This is a fork of [gonew](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/cmd/gonew).
The only difference is that it also edits imports inside .templ files.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/phenpessoa/templnew/cmd/templnew@latest
```

## Usage

Exactly the same as gonew, but use the command templnew instead.
